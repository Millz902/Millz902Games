RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------
- For resource conflicts, ensure only one resource providing each functionality is active.
  Check server.cfg and disable conflicting resources.
- For missing dependencies, ensure all required resources are installed and enabled.
  Check load order to make sure dependencies are loaded before resources that need them.
- For SQL issues, review your SQL files for syntax errors and potential conflicts.
  Ensure table definitions are not duplicated across resources.
- For system functionality issues:
  * Banking: Ensure only ls-bank-advanced is active in server.cfg.
  * Phone: Ensure only smartphone-pro is active in server.cfg.
